Script to install the latest NginX, MySQL and PHP (with APC and Suhosin).
All the steps are described at http://vladgh.com/blog/install-nginx-and-php-php-fpm-mysql-and-apc

HOW TO:

- Make sure you have Git installed on your Ubuntu System:
$ sudo apt-get install git-core screen

- Clone this repository:
$ git clone git://github.com/vladgh/VladGh.com---LEMP.git
$ cd VladGh.com---LEMP

- Run the installer; I recommend running everything inside a screen session because if your connection drops you can easily come back with "$ screen -rad"
$ sudo screen sh install.sh
