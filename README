This package represents a script to install the latest NginX, MySQL and PHP (with APC and Suhosin):

  - NginX 0.9.4
  - PHP 5.3.5
  - APC 3.1.7
  - Suhosin Extension 0.9.32.1

All the steps are described at http://vladgh.com/blog/install-nginx-and-php-php-fpm-mysql-and-apc
It's highly recommended to run this installer on a fresh installed system.
This is tested with Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10, both 32 bits and 64 bits, on official Amazon EC2 Ubuntu images.

HOW TO:

- Make sure you have Git installed on your Ubuntu System:
$ sudo apt-get install git-core screen

- Clone this repository, and get the latest stable version of this script:
$ git clone git://github.com/vladgh/VladGh.com-LEMP.git
$ cd VladGh.com-LEMP
$ git checkout 1.0

- Run the installer; I recommend running everything inside a screen session because if your connection drops you can easily come back with "$ screen -rad"
$ sudo screen sh install.sh

- After the installer is finished (this will take a long time depending on your server specifications), you can go to your servers address and you will see the PHP info page. Also, if you go to http://IP.ADDRESS/apc.php you will find the APC Cache information page.
