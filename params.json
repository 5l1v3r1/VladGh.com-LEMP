{"name":"LEMP","tagline":"Latest NginX, MySQL, PHP","body":"This package represents a script to install the latest NginX, MySQL and PHP (with APC and Suhosin).\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n  * At this moment the Suhosin extension is not available for PHP 5.4.\r\n\r\nYou can install your preferred versions for any of the programs. Just edit the OPTIONS file and change them accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is highly recommended to run this installer on a fresh installed system.\r\n\r\nThis is tested automatically on:\r\n * Ubuntu 10.04, 11.10 and 12.04, both 32 and 64 bit, on official Amazon EC2 Ubuntu images.\r\n * Debian 6, both 32 and 64 bit, on RightScale Debian images.\r\n\r\n####If you find this interesting and you want to keep the development active, please click on the button below to donate:###\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/16676'><img alt='Click here to lend your support to: LEMP Stack and make a donation at www.pledgie.com !' src='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/16676.png?skin_name=chrome' border='0' /></div>\r\n\r\n# HOW TO: #\r\n\r\nMake sure you have Git installed on your Ubuntu System:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install git-core screen\r\n\r\nClone this repository, and get the latest stable version of this script:\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/vladgh/VladGh.com-LEMP.git\r\n    cd VladGh.com-LEMP\r\n\r\nStart a screen session:\r\n\r\n    screen\r\n\r\nI recommend running everything inside a screen session because in case your connection drops you can easily come back with `screen -rad`. If you use something else (ex: byobu) you can skip this step.\r\n\r\nEdit the OPTIONS file and change `ENABLED='yes'`. This is were you can chose to install the MySQL Server or modify the versions for any of the programs, as well as the paths.\r\n\r\nRun the installer:\r\n\r\n    sudo ./install.sh\r\n\r\nAfter the installer is finished (this will take a long time depending on your server specifications), you MUST set your mysql root password:\r\n\r\n    sudo mysqladmin -u root password 'MYPASSWORD'\r\n\r\nYou can go to your server's address and you will see the PHP info page.\r\nAlso, if you go to:\r\n\r\n  * **http://example.com/nginx_status** - for the NginX statistics;\r\n  * **http://example.com/status?html**  - for the FPM statistics;\r\n  * **http://example.com/status.html**  - for the FPM real-time status page;\r\n  * **http://example.com/apc.php**      - for the APC Cache information page.\r\n\r\nIn order to have immediate access to new paths you should also execute `source /etc/environment`. This command reloads the new environment variables.\r\n\r\n# Utilities: #\r\nIn the \"ext\" folder you will also find some utilities:\r\n\r\n* `nxensite` and `nxdissite` commands to enable or disable sites in NginX (similar to a2ensite and a2dissite in Apache).\r\n* `update_nginx.sh` - upgrades or modifies NginX (`sudo ext/update_nginx.sh 1.3.2`).\r\n* `update_php.sh`   - upgrades or modifies PHP (`sudo ext/update_php.sh 5.4.4`).\r\n* `update_apc.sh`   - upgrades or modifies APC (`sudo ext/update_apc.sh 3.1.10`).\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n  * The update_* scripts above can be used to upgrade the software, or change current configure arguments.\r\n  * You can only have one argument in a strict form x.x.x.\r\n  * The `CONFIGURE_ARGS` variable inside can be modified, but make sure the installation directory (`--prefix`) is the same.\r\n\r\n# CONTRIBUTING: #\r\nThis project is still under development. Feedback and suggestions are very welcome and I encourage you to use the [Issues list](https://github.com/vladgh/VladGh.com-LEMP/issues) on Github to provide that feedback.\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork this repository and to commit your additions. When done, open a pull request to your feature branch.\r\n\r\nThe formatting conventions already present in these scripts are as follows:\r\n\r\n* Unix (LF), not dos (CRLF) line endings.\r\n* Two space indentation ([GNU Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#GNU_style)).\r\n* Eliminate all trailing whitespace.\r\n* Aim to wrap code at 80 characters, but favor functionality over wrapping.\r\n* Preserve existing formatting; i.e. do not reformat code for its own sake.\r\n\r\n####If you find this interesting and you want to keep the development active, please click on the button below to donate:###\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/16676'><img alt='Click here to lend your support to: LEMP Stack and make a donation at www.pledgie.com !' src='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/16676.png?skin_name=chrome' border='0' /></div>\r\n\r\n#### If you want to report an issue you can use the tracker available at [https://github.com/vladgh/VladGh.com-LEMP/issues](https://github.com/vladgh/VladGh.com-LEMP/issues). ####\r\n\r\n# DISCLAIMER: #\r\n** All content provided here including the scripts is provided without any warranty.
